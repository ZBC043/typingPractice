Beatrix was born in 1866. She and her brother kept many smallanimals as pets – rabbits, hedgehogs, guinea pigs, mice, frogs andeven bats! They both liked to draw their pets, but Beatrix likeddrawing animals from her own imagination most. She also lovedexploring and drawing nature when they visited beautiful places like Scotland and the Lake District. Beatrix was very smart, and studied archaeological artefacts, fossils and insects, but she wasespecially interested in mycology – the study of mushrooms! She even wrote a scientific paperabout it, but women at that time couldn’t be scientists.To earn some money, Beatrix started drawing cards with animals. She liked writing and illustratingletters too. One day, she wrote a letter to her friend’s son, and told the story of Peter Rabbit.She decided to make the story into a book. The Tale of Peter Rabbit was published in 1902 – and itwas a great success! She wrote, illustrated and published many more books. She also created dolls,painting books, games and other items based on her characters.
