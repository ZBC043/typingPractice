It is important to read texts that are at the right level for you - not too easy, not too difficult. You need to know what your personal reading level is. (Note that your reading level may not be the same as your overall level in English. For example, your reading level is normally higher than your writing level, and higher than your overall level.)Ask your teacher to help you determine your reading level. If you donâ€™t have a teacher, try reading a few texts from different levels. If you have to look up a lot of words in a dictionary, the text is too difficult for you. If you don't have to look up any words, the text is too easy for you. Try something at a lower or higher level. A teacher, librarian or bookstore clerk can help you find something easier or more difficult.You can also try our reading test to help determine your reading level.Designate a place and time for reading every day.
